Hi there! 👋

Welcome to **Refactored Doodle**, my little corner of the internet where I blend creativity, curiosity, and code. This site is more than just a portfolio — it’s a digital sketchpad where I share my experiments, mini-projects, and lessons learned on the way.

## 🎨 Why the name *Refactored Doodle*?

Great question.  

- **Refactored**: Because I believe no code is perfect on the first try. Iteration is where the magic happens.  
- **Doodle**: Because every idea starts rough — a scribble, a sketch, a spark. Creativity lives in the mess.

Put them together, and you've got the spirit of this project: learning out loud, building in public, and embracing the process.

## 💻 What’s this project about?

This site is:

- A home for my **mini side projects** and **coding experiments**.
- A place to **blog about what I’m learning** — whether it’s Python snippets, design patterns, or debugging late-night bugs.
- A sandbox where I’m learning how to use tools like **GitHub Pages**, **Tailwind CSS**, and eventually maybe even **React or Svelte** (we'll see 👀).

## ✨ What’s coming up?

Over the next few weeks, I’ll be adding:

- 💡 **Projects** I’m working on (with clean UI and even cleaner code).
- 📚 **Learnings** from courses, tutorials, and real-world challenges.
- 💭 **Thoughts** on programming, creativity, and imposter syndrome (because… let’s be real).
